## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis project. It leverages SQL to analyze customer behavior, segment customers, calculate customer lifetime value (CLV), and even implement a recommendation engine.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main steps:

### Step 1: Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis

In this step, we segment customers based on purchase frequency, purchase recency, and purchase value. These segments help us understand customer behavior and preferences.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Frequency

    Question: How often do customers make purchases?
    Answer: Customers are categorized as "Frequent," "Regular," or "Infrequent" based on their purchase frequency.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Recency

    Question: How recently did customers make their last purchase?
    Answer: Customers are categorized as "Recent," "Recent but not so Recent," or "Not Recent" based on their last purchase month or quarter.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Value

    Question: What is the monetary value of customer purchases?
    Answer: Customers are categorized as "High-Value," "Medium-Value," or "Low-Value" based on the total monetary value of their purchases.

### Step 2: Behavioral Analysis

In this step, we dive deeper into customer behavior within each segment.

#### Customer Purchase Patterns

We analyze customer purchase patterns within each segment, identifying common product categories, purchase timing, and average transaction values.

    Question: What are the common product categories that customers purchase?
    Answer: This analysis identifies the product categories that are frequently purchased by customers within each segment.

    Question: What is the timing of customer purchases?
    Answer: We analyze when customers tend to make purchases, which helps identify purchase timing patterns.

    Question: What is the average transaction value for customers in each segment?
    Answer: This analysis provides insights into the average transaction value for customers within each segment, helping to understand their spending habits.

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

We calculate the CLV for each customer segment by projecting future revenue based on historical data.
    
    Question: What is the projected future revenue from each customer segment based on historical data?
    Answer: CLV is calculated for each customer segment by projecting future revenue based on their past transaction history.

#### Recommendation Engine

    Question: How can we suggest products to customers based on their past purchase behavior?
    Answer: A simple recommendation engine is implemented to suggest products to customers based on their purchase history and the behavior of similar customers.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes:

- SQL scripts for database creation and data insertion.
- SQL queries for customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.

## Database Schema

The project uses a relational database with the following schema:

- Customers: Contains customer information.
- Products: Stores product details.
- Transactions: Records customer transactions.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Create the database and tables using the provided SQL scripts.
2. Insert sample data into the tables.
3. Run the SQL queries for customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.
4. Review the results and insights obtained from the analysis.
