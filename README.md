## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis project. It leverages SQL to analyze customer behavior, segment customers, calculate customer lifetime value (CLV), and even implement a recommendation engine.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main steps:

### Step 1: Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis

In this step, we segment customers based on purchase frequency, purchase recency, and purchase value. These segments help us understand customer behavior and preferences.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Frequency

Customers are categorized as "Frequent," "Regular," or "Infrequent" based on their purchase frequency.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Recency

Customers are categorized as "Recent," "Recent but not so Recent," or "Not Recent" based on their last purchase month or quarter.

#### Segmentation by Purchase Value

Customers are categorized as "High-Value," "Medium-Value," or "Low-Value" based on their total monetary value of purchases.

### Step 2: Behavioral Analysis

In this step, we dive deeper into customer behavior within each segment.

#### Customer Purchase Patterns

We analyze customer purchase patterns within each segment, identifying common product categories, purchase timing, and average transaction values.

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

We calculate the CLV for each customer segment by projecting future revenue based on historical data.

#### Recommendation Engine

We implement a simple recommendation engine that suggests products to customers based on their purchase history and the behavior of similar customers.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes:

- SQL scripts for database creation and data insertion.
- SQL queries for customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.
- Extensive README for project documentation.

## Database Schema

The project uses a relational database with the following schema:

- Customers: Contains customer information.
- Products: Stores product details.
- Transactions: Records customer transactions.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Create the database and tables using the provided SQL scripts.
2. Insert sample data into the tables.
3. Run the SQL queries for customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.
4. Review the results and insights obtained from the analysis.

Feel free to customize the SQL queries and adapt them to your specific business needs.
